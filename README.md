OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

PROJECT:AI-BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Objective:

The objective of the AI-based Recommendation System in Java is to analyze user data and preferences to provide personalized recommendations. The system aims to apply basic artificial intelligence techniques to identify patterns in user behavior and suggest relevant items, thereby improving user experience and decision-making. It also helps in understanding how AI concepts can be implemented using Java for real-world applications.

Key Activities:

*Requirement analysis and system design

*Data collection and preprocessing

*Implementing AI/ML algorithms (e.g., similarity, classification, or filtering)

*Developing recommendation logic in Java

*Generating personalized recommendations

*Testing, evaluation, and optimization of results

Technologies Used:

*Java

*Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning concepts

*Data Processing & Analysis

*Algorithms for Recommendation (e.g., collaborative or content-based filtering)

*Java Collections Framework

*Basic Database / File Handling (for storing user data)

OUTPUT:
